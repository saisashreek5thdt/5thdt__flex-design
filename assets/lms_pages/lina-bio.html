                        Lina Ashar did her primary schooling in England before
                        moving to Australia, where she acquired a bachelor’s
                        degree in Education from Melbourne’s, Victoria College.
                        In 1991, she came to India on a year-long sabbatical
                        from college. While connecting with her roots, she
                        landed up taking a teaching stint at a prestigious
                        heritage school in suburban Mumbai, an experience that
                        changed her life and led to the burning question “How
                        can she bring back the joy of childhood for the children
                        in India?”
                      </p>

                        Back then, the education system in India was still
                        grappling with a straitjacketed approach to education.
                        It was robbing children of their childhood. She was
                        appalled by a lackluster system of education that upheld
                        only the high-flyers. Crammed classrooms, disinterested
                        students, and over-stressed parents inspired her to work
                        on a model of education that was fulfilling, effective,
                        and yet stress-free.

                        The conviction to offer an education that set the child
                        at the centre, began with a preschool in Bandra (Mumbai)
                        in the year 1993 with 25 students. With a successful
                        formula at hand, she went from one preschool (Kangaroo
                        Kids) to a network of them, whilst branching out to high
                        schools (Billabong High International School) as well.
                        The journey of developing child-centric schools across
                        44+ different cities in India and across Dubai,
                        Maldives, and Qatar has been an outstanding one,
                        supported by parents, education partners, and a fierce
                        team of dedicated, passionate, and determined
                        individuals at the school and central team level.

                        In her endeavour to make a difference in every child’s
                        life, she wrote her first book called ‘Who Do you Think
                        You Are Kidding’. The book dealt with parenting for
                        children and is a complete guide for parents on how to
                        build a positive child right from the start. Teenage, as
                        we all know, is the most difficult stage in life and the
                        one where parents and children have the maximum amount
                        of friction. Her second book ‘Drama Teen’, is a guide
                        for both parents and teens.

In 1991, she came to India on a year-long sabbatical from college. While connecting with her roots, she landed up taking a teaching stint at a prestigious heritage school in suburban Mumbai, an experience that changed her life and led to the burning question “How can she bring back the joy of childhood for the children in India?”</p>
